I was thinking about creating Artificial Intelligence for a while.

It should be noted that this is most likely going to be written in Java because:

Java takes care of memory allocations automatically.

Classes and Inheritance are essential to Java.

There are lots of repositories already created in Java

Many people know Java, it is not specialized like R, LISP, etc...
